    //  - composite_query function can only call other composite_query and query functions.
    //  - composite_query function can only be called from other composite_query functions (not callable from query or update functions) and from outside of IC. Therefore, query is not a subtype of composite_query.
    //  - composite_query cannot be made cross-subnets.
    //  - All these limitations are temporary due to the implementation. Eventually, query and composite_query functions will become the same thing.
